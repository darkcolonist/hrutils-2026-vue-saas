Act as a Full-Stack Engineer. I am migrating a Laravel 10 project to a decoupled architecture: Vue 3 (Vite) on the frontend and Supabase as the backend.

Task 1: Migration & Structure

Create a new frontend/ directory using Vue 3 + Vite.

Move all existing Laravel files into a legacy/ folder.

Set up the directory structure in frontend/ to include folders for views/, components/, composables/, and store/ (Pinia).

Task 2: Supabase Integration

Install and initialize @supabase/supabase-js.

Create a supabase.js client utility.

Implement Email Login using Supabase Auth. Reference the schema from @beautifulMention to ensure user fields match.

Task 3: Cloudflare Pages Optimization

Configure vite.config.js and a wrangler.toml (if needed) for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.

Ensure routing is handled (e.g., a _redirects file for SPA routing).

Goal: I want to be able to run npm install && npm run dev inside the frontend/ folder and see a working login page that authenticates against my Supabase instance. Proceed.

change this project into nodejs + vue that i will host into cloudflare pages, move legacy files in a separate folder, feel free to create your own directory structure. my backend datasource will be supabase. it will also be login using email from supabase check schema from @beautifulMention 

after you're done i can run npm run dev and i can view the final product.
